👋 Hi, I’m @millanoo <br>
.. and I love to explore modern Hubs.. 👀 (Git, Nextcloud ...)
<br>
<br>
I’m floating over possible ways to develop several ideas - into apps as solutions with benefits for each side of users
<br><br>
🌱 I’m currently understanding - how to minify everything, what is just discovered & defined.<br>
(peace out for time-counters / money-lovers) ..  I am in love with my ideas :)<br>
<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building "library".. a Hub of avail-able<br>
- that allow us to transform our ideas into reality <br>
- with simple language of logic, that is working for ages<br>
<br>
  ... The time of every symbols .!)'=, where importance from latest grammars could come whenever, but after<br>
  .. the IDEAS /head of successfull apps/ <br>
  . will works in reality for first groups of users<br>
<br>
<br>
📫 I dont wanna waste another time with explaining my ideas<br>
.. to get another NO reason .. <br>
<br>
... its going to be 2022 soon ...<br>
.. never ever 2020, '19, '18 ..<br>
. lets give up conservative habits.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope, that somebody will be found, while I am collecting YES, in Yes places, on my way.<br>
..can U imagine it as well - that the future can start e.g. before next morning begins?<br>
<br>
